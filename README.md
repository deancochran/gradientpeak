## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

TurboFit is organized as a **Turborepo monorepo** with modular packages:

### 📦 Core Package (`packages/core`)

The heart of TurboFit, shared across web, mobile, and backend apps. **Completely independent of database or ORM dependencies.**

**Responsibilities:**

* **Type Definitions & Schemas** — Zod validation for profiles, activities, activities, and flexible JSON structures
* **Calculations & Analytics** — Training zones, TSS, normalized power, compliance scoring, CTL/ATL/TSB
* **Business Logic** — Activity plan validation, progression, and adaptive algorithms
* **Utilities** — Time/duration helpers, unit conversions, constants
* **Platform Agnostic** — Pure TypeScript with no database, ORM, or platform-specific dependencies

**Key Benefit:** Single source of truth ensures consistent calculations, type safety, and validation across all applications while remaining completely portable and testable in isolation.

---



### 📦 TypeScript Config Package (`packages/typescript-config`)

A shared TypeScript configuration used across all apps and packages in the TurboFit monorepo.

**Responsibilities:**

* **Centralized TS Configuration** — Base `tsconfig` defines compiler options, strict type checking, and module resolution
* **Standardized Paths & Aliases** — Ensures consistent `@/*` imports across apps
* **Extensible per App** — Apps can extend the base config for Next.js, Expo, or library-specific overrides
* **Version Control** — Single source of truth for TypeScript settings to reduce discrepancies and errors

**Key Benefit:** All apps and packages share a **consistent TypeScript environment**, simplifying cross-package type safety and refactoring.

---

### 📦 ESLint Config Package (`packages/eslint-config`)

A shared ESLint configuration used across all apps and packages in the TurboFit monorepo.

**Responsibilities:**

* **Centralized Linting Rules** — Base ESLint rules and plugins (`@eslint/js`, `typescript-eslint`, `eslint-config-prettier`) applied across all apps
* **Next.js & React Support** — Optional per-app overrides for Next.js or React library requirements
* **Custom Plugins** — Turbo-specific rules, `eslint-plugin-only-warn`, and other shared rules enforced consistently
* **Ignored Paths** — Standard exclusions for `dist`, `.next`, and build artifacts

**Key Benefit:** Provides **uniform code quality standards** across all apps and packages, making maintenance and onboarding simpler.

## 🧑‍💻 Profiles & Preferences

User-centric design anchors the system around **profiles** extended from `auth.users`. The core package provides enhanced profile interfaces and validation schemas for athlete-specific metrics:

| Field             | Description                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`              | Primary key, UUID, FK → `auth.users.id`             |
| `threshold_hr`    | Threshold heart rate (bpm); nullable for new users  |
| `ftp`             | Functional Threshold Power (watts); nullable        |
| `weight_kg`       | Athlete's weight for power-to-weight calculations   |
| `gender`          | Used in predictive models and analytics             |
| `dob`             | Date of birth; calculates age-based zones & targets |
| `username`        | Unique public-facing handle                         |
| `language`        | Preferred UI language/locale                        |
| `preferred_units` | Metric vs imperial                                  |
| `avatar_url`      | Optional profile picture/avatar                     |
| `bio`             | Optional short biography                            |

The core package handles **profile validation**, **training zone calculations**, and **unit conversions** for personalized experiences.

## 📋 Training Plans & Planned Activities

### Profile Plans

`profile_plans` stores personalized training plans generated from library templates. The **core package** provides **plan validation**, **progression algorithms**, and **adaptation logic**.

### Planned Activities

`planned_activities` contains scheduled activities with flexible JSON structures validated by the **core package**:

* `structure` — Complex JSON objects defining activity steps
* `structure_version` — Version tracked by core package
* `requires_threshold_hr` / `requires_ftp` — Validated against core profile requirements
* Performance estimates calculated by core algorithms

**Activity Structure Features:**

## 🏃 Activity Storage & Performance Analysis

### JSON-First Activity Architecture

TurboFit uses a **JSON-first approach** where all activity data is stored as the single source of truth:

* **Primary Storage** — Complete activity data stored as JSON in Supabase Storage
* **Local Recording** — Activities initially captured locally in SQLite as JSON
* **Cloud Sync** — JSON objects uploaded to Supabase Storage when network available
* **Metadata Generation** — Activity records created locally and synced after JSON storage
* **Stream Processing** — Activity streams generated from JSON after successful upload

**Data Flow:**
1. **Record** → Local SQLite stores complete activity as JSON
2. **Upload** → JSON object uploaded to Supabase Storage (source of truth)
3. **Process** → Activity metadata record generated locally and inserted
4. **Streams** → Activity streams generated and inserted after JSON processing
5. **Analytics** — Core package processes JSON for performance calculations

### Performance Analysis

Activity data flows through the **core package** for consistent analysis:

* **Performance Metrics** — TSS, normalized power, intensity factors calculated from JSON
* **Training Load Analytics** — CTL, ATL, TSB derived from activity metadata
* **Compliance Scoring** — Activity matching algorithms using JSON activity structure
* **Zone Analysis** — Training zone calculations using core package algorithms

### Activity Streams

Time-series data processed from JSON source through core package utilities:

* **Generated from JSON** — All streams derived from primary JSON activity data
* **Standardized Metrics** — Core package ensures consistent metric types and validation
* **Performance Curves** — Power/HR curves calculated from JSON streams
* **Real-time Processing** — Stream aggregation during activity recording

---

## 🔄 Local-First Architecture

* **Record Locally** — Expo-SQLite captures complete activities as JSON with core package validation
* **JSON Source of Truth** — All activity data stored primarily as JSON objects
* **Background Sync** — Core package ensures data integrity during upload process
* **Metadata Derivation** — Activity records and streams generated from JSON post-upload
* **Conflict Resolution** — Smart merging using JSON timestamps and core validation

---
