### Recently Completed

- ✅ **ActivityRecorder Performance Optimization**: Successfully refactored recording modals to use optimized Zustand store
  - ✅ Removed ActivityRecorderProvider entirely (~200 lines deleted)
  - ✅ Added granular Zustand selectors for specific metrics (useHeartRate, usePower, useGPSMetrics, etc.)
  - ✅ Updated all recording modal files (index.tsx, activity.tsx, permissions.tsx, sensors.tsx) to use efficient selectors
  - ✅ Optimized for realtime metric updates with surgical re-renders (1-4Hz sensor data)
  - ✅ Added useActivityRecorderInit hook for service initialization with proper async handling
  - ✅ Fixed React state update warnings by preventing render-time side effects
  - ✅ Fixed property reference errors by removing old liveMetrics/connectedSensors parameters
  - ✅ Added initialization guards to prevent component render before service is ready
  - ✅ Fixed background location task cleanup errors with proper TaskManager error handling
  - ✅ Improved location service error handling for task registration/cleanup edge cases
  - ✅ **Service-Based Timing**: Moved elapsed time calculation from UI to ActivityRecorder service for background accuracy
  - ✅ **Live Metrics Enhancement**: Added elapsedTime, distance, latitude/longitude to live metrics with proper updates
  - ✅ **GPS Distance Tracking**: Implemented Haversine formula for accurate distance calculation from GPS coordinates
  - ✅ **Background-Safe Operations**: Timing and metrics continue accurately when app is backgrounded
  - ✅ **Dashboard Metrics Display**: Dashboard now shows real-time service metrics instead of placeholder content
  - ✅ **Fixed Elapsed Time Display**: Corrected elapsed time formatting issue (removed incorrect millisecond conversion)
  - ✅ **Improved Timer Logic**: Simplified elapsed time calculation with proper pause/resume handling
  - ✅ All runtime errors resolved - recording modals now work correctly with full metrics and optimized performance
  - ✅ Maintained all existing functionality while improving performance, accuracy, and reliability
