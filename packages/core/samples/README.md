## Usage

### Import All Samples
```typescript
import { SAMPLE_ACTIVITIES } from "@gradientpeak/core/samples";
// Returns array with all 36 workout plans
```

### Import Specific Activity Type
```typescript
import { 
  SAMPLE_OUTDOOR_RUN_ACTIVITIES,
  SAMPLE_INDOOR_TRAINER_ACTIVITIES,
  // ... etc
} from "@gradientpeak/core/samples";
```

### Get Activities by Type
```typescript
import { getSampleActivitiesByType } from "@gradientpeak/core/samples";

const runWorkouts = getSampleActivitiesByType('outdoor_run');
const bikeWorkouts = getSampleActivitiesByType('indoor_bike_trainer');
```

### Access Type-Indexed Collection
```typescript
import { SAMPLE_ACTIVITIES_BY_TYPE } from "@gradientpeak/core/samples";

// Access workouts by activity type
const strengthWorkouts = SAMPLE_ACTIVITIES_BY_TYPE.indoor_strength;
const swimWorkouts = SAMPLE_ACTIVITIES_BY_TYPE.indoor_swim;
```

## Workout Structure

Each workout plan follows the `RecordingServiceActivityPlan` schema:

```typescript
interface RecordingServiceActivityPlan {
  version: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  activity_type: PublicActivityType;
  estimated_tss?: number;
  estimated_duration?: number; // in seconds
  structure: {
    steps: Array<WorkoutStep | RepetitionBlock>;
  };
}
```

### Step Types

1. **Simple Steps** - Single duration with targets and notes
2. **Repetition Blocks** - Repeated sets of steps for intervals
3. **Nested Structures** - Complex workouts with multiple phases

### Target Types

Workouts include various target intensities:
- `%FTP` - Percentage of Functional Threshold Power (cycling)
- `%ThresholdHR` - Percentage of Threshold Heart Rate (running/general)
- Power zones and heart rate zones

## Development

When adding new sample workouts:

1. Create workout constants following naming convention: `WORKOUT_NAME_TYPE`
2. Export individual workouts for direct access
3. Add to the appropriate `SAMPLE_<ACTIVITY>_ACTIVITIES` array
4. Ensure each activity type has at least 5 varied workouts
5. Include realistic TSS and duration estimates
6. Provide clear descriptions and notes for guidance

## Testing

These samples are used throughout the application for:
- UI component development and testing
- Activity recording simulation
- Compliance scoring validation
- Navigation flow testing
- API integration testing

## Notes

- All durations are specified in seconds
- Intensity targets are percentages (0-100+)
- Each workout includes detailed notes for user guidance
- Workouts range from recovery (TSS ~20) to high intensity (TSS ~95)
- Duration ranges from 30 minutes to 2 hours
