## System Overview

The fitness tracking application operates in three distinct phases: real-time data recording during workouts, immediate local processing after workout completion, and background synchronization with cloud services. The system is designed to never lose workout data while providing immediate user feedback and ensuring eventual consistency with the remote database.

### Core Principles
- **Data Preservation**: Raw workout data is never lost, regardless of system failures
- **Immediate Feedback**: Users see workout results immediately after completion
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating even when components fail
- **Resumable Operations**: All long-running processes can be interrupted and resumed
- **Idempotent Operations**: Retry operations don't create duplicate data

## Data Structures

### JSON File Structure
Each workout is stored as a single JSON file containing both raw sensor data and processing metadata. The file serves as the single source of truth throughout the entire data pipeline.

#### Activity Metadata
The metadata section tracks processing progress, error states, and system state transitions. Key fields include processing stage indicators, offset markers for resumable operations, retry counters, error details, and data integrity checksums.

#### Sensor Data Arrays
Raw sensor readings are stored in chronological arrays with timestamps. Each data point contains metrics such as heart rate, power output, speed, cadence, GPS coordinates, and movement status. Data points are appended in real-time during workouts with minimal processing overhead.

#### Calculated Summaries
Post-workout calculated metrics are stored alongside raw data, including total and moving time, average and peak values, distance calculations, and performance indicators. These summaries enable immediate user feedback without reprocessing raw data.

### Database Schema
The local SQLite database uses Drizzle ORM schemas optimized for mobile performance, containing activities tables for workout summaries and activity streams tables for detailed time-series data. The remote Supabase database mirrors this structure with additional cloud-specific optimizations.

## Core Data Flow

### Phase 1: Real-Time Data Recording

#### Sensor Integration
The application continuously receives data from multiple sources including ANT+ and Bluetooth Low Energy sensors for physiological and power metrics, device GPS for location tracking, and internal sensors for motion detection. Data collection operates on a 1-5 second interval depending on sensor type and battery optimization requirements.

#### Buffer Management
Incoming sensor data is immediately written to the JSON file buffer array using atomic file operations. Each write operation updates the file checksum and maintains data integrity markers. The system uses memory-efficient streaming writes to handle long workouts without memory pressure.

#### Real-Time Display
Current workout metrics are maintained in application memory for live display updates. The system provides immediate feedback to users including current power, heart rate, elapsed time, distance, and other relevant metrics without impacting data recording performance.

### Phase 2: Immediate Local Processing

#### Workout Completion Trigger
When users complete a workout, the system immediately marks the JSON file as ready for processing and navigates to the home screen where processing occurs transparently in the background.

#### Progressive Processing Pipeline
The local processing occurs in distinct, resumable stages. First, JSON parsing operates on manageable chunks rather than loading the entire file into memory. Second, metric calculations process data incrementally with progress tracking. Third, database operations use transactions with checkpointing for crash recovery.

#### Summary Generation
The system calculates essential workout metrics including time-based calculations for total and moving duration, statistical analysis for averages, peaks, and distributions, derived metrics such as Training Stress Score and Intensity Factor, and geospatial calculations for distance and elevation.

#### Local Database Population
Calculated summaries are inserted into the local activities table, while detailed time-series data is batch-inserted into activity streams tables. All operations use database transactions with rollback capability and maintain referential integrity between activities and their associated stream data.

### Phase 3: Background Synchronization

#### Sync Queue Management
The system maintains a queue of activities requiring cloud synchronization, prioritizing recent activities while ensuring older activities eventually sync. Failed sync attempts are tracked separately with exponential backoff retry scheduling.

#### Cloud Upload Process
Synchronization occurs in batches to optimize network usage and server performance. The system uploads activity summaries first to establish cloud records, followed by time-series data in configurable batch sizes. Each batch operation includes integrity verification and rollback capability.

#### Conflict Resolution
When conflicts arise between local and remote data, the system prioritizes data preservation over consistency, typically favoring the most complete dataset. Users are notified of conflicts when manual resolution is required.

## Fault Tolerance Architecture

### Atomic Operations
All critical data operations use atomic file writes and database transactions. JSON file updates use temporary files with atomic rename operations to prevent corruption. Database operations wrap multiple related inserts in single transactions with proper rollback handling.

### Checkpointing Strategy
The system maintains multiple levels of progress indicators including parse progress through raw data, database insertion offsets, and remote synchronization progress. Checkpoints are updated after each successful operation batch, enabling precise resume operations after interruptions.

### Data Integrity Verification
Multiple validation layers ensure data consistency including real-time format validation during recording, post-processing logical consistency checks, pre-sync compatibility verification, and post-sync integrity confirmation.

### Redundancy and Backup
Raw workout data is preserved until successful cloud synchronization is confirmed. Local database records are maintained even after sync completion for offline access. Critical metadata is duplicated across file and database storage.

## Error Classification and Recovery

### Transient Errors
Network timeouts, temporary database locks, and memory pressure situations are classified as transient. These errors trigger automatic retry with exponential backoff, typically resolving within minutes without user intervention.

### Retryable Errors
Data validation failures, server errors, and resource constraints are considered retryable with user notification. The system attempts automatic recovery a limited number of times before requiring user action or manual intervention.

### Fatal Errors
Data corruption, schema incompatibilities, and permanent server rejections are classified as fatal. These errors halt automatic processing but preserve raw data for manual recovery or debugging.

### Recovery Procedures
The system implements comprehensive recovery procedures for various failure scenarios. Crash recovery detects incomplete operations on application startup and resumes processing from last known checkpoints. Data corruption recovery attempts to salvage partial data and provides options for manual intervention. Sync failure recovery maintains local data integrity while providing multiple retry strategies.

## State Management

### Processing State Machine
Activities progress through well-defined states from initial data collection through final synchronization. State transitions are atomic and logged for debugging purposes. Each state defines valid next states and recovery procedures for failure scenarios.

### Progress Tracking
Detailed progress information enables accurate user feedback and efficient recovery operations. Progress indicators include percentage completion, estimated time remaining, current processing stage, and error status when applicable.

### Concurrency Control
The system prevents conflicting operations on the same activity while allowing parallel processing of different activities. Database operations use appropriate locking strategies to maintain consistency without blocking user interface responsiveness.

## User Experience Design

### Immediate Feedback
Users receive workout summaries immediately after completion, regardless of processing or sync status. Essential metrics are calculated and displayed within seconds of workout completion.

### Progressive Enhancement
The user interface progressively enhances as more detailed processing completes. Initial summaries expand to include detailed analytics and visualizations as background processing finishes.

### Error Communication
Error states are communicated clearly with actionable recovery options. Users understand the difference between temporary delays and permanent failures. Critical errors provide detailed information for support or debugging purposes.

### Offline Capability
Full application functionality remains available without network connectivity. Workout recording, basic analysis, and historical data access work seamlessly offline with sync occurring automatically when connectivity returns.

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
The system operates efficiently on mobile devices with limited memory through streaming data processing, aggressive memory cleanup, and efficient data structures optimized for mobile platforms.

### Battery Optimization
Data recording minimizes battery impact through optimized sensor polling intervals, efficient file I/O operations, and background processing that respects system resource constraints.

### Storage Efficiency
Local storage usage is managed through automatic cleanup of synced data, compression of historical records, and user-configurable retention policies.

### Network Optimization
Sync operations optimize network usage through batch uploads, compression, and intelligent scheduling based on network conditions and user preferences.

## Monitoring and Observability

### System Metrics
The application tracks key performance indicators including processing times by stage, error rates by category, sync success rates, and resource utilization patterns.

### User Analytics
User-facing metrics help optimize the experience including workout completion rates, sync reliability statistics, and feature usage patterns.

### Debugging Support
Comprehensive logging and diagnostic information support troubleshooting including detailed error logs, processing timelines, and data integrity reports.

### Health Monitoring
The system continuously monitors its own health including file system integrity, database consistency, network connectivity status, and resource availability.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive data flow and fault tolerance design ensures reliable workout data capture and processing while maintaining excellent user experience. The system gracefully handles various failure scenarios while preserving data integrity and providing users with immediate feedback about their fitness activities. Through careful attention to mobile platform constraints and user expectations, the application delivers enterprise-grade reliability in a consumer fitness context.
