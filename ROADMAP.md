# TurboFit Mobile App - MVP Roadmap

## ðŸŽ¯ MVP Focus

This roadmap focuses on the **three essential features** needed to compete with Strava/TrainingPeaks as a viable fitness tracking alternative. All features are designed around the **JSON-first architecture** where activities are stored as complete JSON objects in Supabase Storage.

---

## ðŸ“Š Current State Analysis

### âœ… **Solid Foundation Already Built**
- **Authentication System**: Complete Supabase auth with all screens
- **Activity Recording**: Advanced GPS tracking, BLE sensors, fault-tolerant recording
- **Local-First Architecture**: Expo SQLite with JSON storage and cloud sync
- **UI Infrastructure**: NativeWind styling, tab navigation, reusable components
- **Core Business Logic**: Database-independent @repo/core package with calculations
- **Profile Management**: User profiles, FTP, threshold HR, training zones

### ðŸ”„ **Architecture Strengths**
- **JSON Source of Truth**: Activities stored as complete JSON in Supabase Storage
- **Database-Independent Core**: Pure TypeScript calculations without ORM dependencies
- **Offline-First**: Local SQLite recording with intelligent cloud sync
- **Metadata Generation**: Activity records and streams derived from JSON post-upload

### ðŸŽ¯ **MVP Gap Analysis**
The mobile app has **excellent infrastructure** but displays **mock data**. The main work is **connecting real data flows** through the existing well-designed system.

## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation Notes

### **JSON-First Architecture Considerations**
- All activity analysis derives from JSON stored in Supabase Storage
- Activity metadata records are generated locally and synced post-JSON upload
- Activity streams are created from JSON data after successful cloud storage
- @repo/core package processes JSON independently of database structure

### **Database Independence**
- @repo/core package remains completely database-agnostic
- All business logic calculations work on JSON data structures
- Database queries handled by Drizzle package, not core package
- Type safety maintained through JSON schema validation

### **Performance Optimization**
- Cache frequently accessed activity JSON for offline analysis
- Implement efficient JSON parsing and calculation pipelines
- Use React Query for intelligent data caching and synchronization
- Optimize large activity dataset handling with virtualization
