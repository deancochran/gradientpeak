# TurboFit Mobile App Roadmap - MVP Completion

## üîç Current State Analysis

Based on comprehensive codebase analysis, TurboFit has a solid foundation with advanced activity recording, authentication, and UI infrastructure. However, several critical features need completion to reach MVP status and compete with Strava/TrainingPeaks.

### ‚úÖ **Completed Core Infrastructure**
- **Authentication System**: Complete Supabase auth flow with all screens
- **Activity Recording**: Advanced GPS tracking, BLE sensors, background recording with fault tolerance
- **Local-First Architecture**: Expo SQLite with cloud sync capabilities
- **FIT File Processing**: Backend JSON-to-FIT conversion with @garmin/fitsdk
- **UI Foundation**: NativeWind styling, reusable components, tab navigation
- **Profile Management**: User profiles with FTP, threshold HR, training zones
- **Core Business Logic**: @repo/core package with calculations, schemas, validations

### üîÑ **Partially Implemented Features**
- **Home Screen**: Activity dashboard structure exists but uses mock performance data
- **Plan Screen**: Calendar UI complete but displays mock planned activities
- **Trends Screen**: Victory Native charts ready but shows mock analytics
- **Settings Screen**: Profile editing works, missing advanced preferences
- **Performance Metrics Hook**: Calculations available but not connected to real data
