# TurboFit Production Readiness Assessment (Mobile-Focused)

## ðŸš¨ Critical Gaps Analysis

### **Core Package (`packages/core`) - Major Deficiencies**

**Current State:** Almost empty

* `calculations/index.ts` - **EMPTY**
* `types/index.ts` - **EMPTY**
* Only 2 basic Zod schemas exist

**Reasoning:** The Core package is the single source of truth for all calculations, validation, and business logic. Without these implementations, the mobile app cannot record activities, calculate training metrics, or validate user data reliably.

**Required Implementation & Tasks:**

1. **Type Definitions & Validation Schemas**

   * **Tasks:**

     * Complete profile schemas
     * Workout structure validation
     * Activity result validation
     * Stream data validation
   * **Reasoning:** Ensures data consistency, type safety, and proper validation across all activity and profile operations in the mobile app.

2. **Training Calculations & Analytics**

   * **Tasks:**

     * Heart rate, power, and pace zone calculations
     * TSS calculation algorithms
     * Normalized Power calculations
     * Compliance scoring algorithms
     * CTL/ATL/TSB modeling
   * **Reasoning:** Core calculations enable meaningful performance metrics, adaptive training, and analytics for mobile users.

3. **Business Logic**

   * **Tasks:**

     * Workout plan validation and progression
     * Adaptive algorithms based on performance metrics
   * **Reasoning:** Supports automated, data-driven guidance in mobile workouts and ensures correct application of training principles.

4. **Utilities & Helpers**

   * **Tasks:**

     * Time/duration utilities
     * Unit conversion functions
     * Constants and helper functions
   * **Reasoning:** Provides reusable functions for calculations, prevents errors, and standardizes measurement units across the app.

### **Drizzle Backend Package (`packages/drizzle`) - Major Deficiencies**

**Current State:** Partially implemented

* Schema and migrations exist
* TypeScript integration present
* Missing queries, transactions, and sync logic

**Reasoning:** Drizzle is the mobile backend interface for persistent storage and sync. Without proper queries and transactions, mobile data cannot be stored reliably, conflicts cannot be resolved, and offline-first behavior is broken.

**Required Implementation & Tasks:**

1. **Schema Definition**

   * **Tasks:**

     * Ensure tables for user profiles, activities, training plans, and analytics exist
     * Define proper relations and constraints
   * **Reasoning:** Guarantees data integrity and supports complex queries required by the mobile app.

2. **Query Functions**

   * **Tasks:**

     * CRUD operations for profiles and activities
     * Aggregation queries for analytics
     * Queries to support TSS/CTL/ATL calculations
   * **Reasoning:** Type-safe queries allow mobile app to read/write data correctly and enable analytics to function offline and online.

3. **Transaction Helpers**

   * **Tasks:**

     * Bulk sync operations for offline queue
     * Atomic activity creation
     * Profile updates with dependent records
   * **Reasoning:** Ensures database consistency during multi-step operations and offline-to-online sync.

4. **Conflict Resolution & Sync**

   * **Tasks:**

     * Delta sync implementation
     * Conflict resolution algorithms
     * Background queue handling
   * **Reasoning:** Critical for offline-first mobile operation and maintaining data integrity when syncing with backend.

---

### **Mobile App (`apps/native`) - Major Deficiencies**

**Current State:** Skeleton only

* Local-first storage set up
* Auth contexts present
* No recording, sync, or real-time tracking implemented

**Reasoning:** The mobile app is the user-facing component. Without these features, users cannot record activities, view metrics, or benefit from offline-first sync.

**Required Implementation & Tasks:**

1. **Activity Recording**

   * **Tasks:**

     * Real-time GPS tracking
     * Sensor data collection (HR, power, cadence)
     * Local storage optimization
     * Background processing
   * **Reasoning:** Captures accurate workout data for metrics and performance tracking even when offline.

2. **Sync Infrastructure**

   * **Tasks:**

     * Queue management system for pending operations
     * Conflict resolution algorithms
     * Retry mechanisms
     * Background sync service
   * **Reasoning:** Ensures offline activity data is reliably synced to backend without user intervention.

3. **User Interface**

   * **Tasks:**

     * Start/stop workout interface
     * Real-time metrics display
     * GPS tracking visualization
   * **Reasoning:** Provides users with actionable feedback and a smooth UX while recording workouts.

4. **Profile Management**

   * **Tasks:**

     * Settings configuration
     * Threshold testing tools
     * Zone configuration
   * **Reasoning:** Allows personalization of training zones and thresholds, which are necessary for accurate calculations and adaptive guidance.

### **Shared Infrastructure - Support Tasks**

**Reasoning:** These tasks are necessary to ensure consistency across Core, Drizzle, and Mobile packages:

* **TypeScript throughout Turborepo** â†’ Enforces type safety
* **Core package shared logic** â†’ Prevents duplicate implementations
* **Drizzle package for database & sync** â†’ Ensures offline-first reliability
* **Mobile app leveraging local-first + sync** â†’ Provides seamless offline/online experience

### ðŸš€ Immediate Next Steps (Mobile-Focused)

1. **Implement Core Package logic**
2. **Create full validation schemas**
3. **Build query functions and transactions in Drizzle**
4. **Implement activity recording, background processing, and sync in mobile app**
5. **Develop user interface for workouts and profile management**
