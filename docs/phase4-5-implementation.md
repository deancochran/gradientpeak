## Phase 4: Workout Scheduling with Constraint Validation

### Goal
Enable users to schedule workouts with real-time validation against training plan constraints, providing immediate feedback on plan adherence.

### What Was Built

#### 1. Backend: Constraint Validation Endpoint
**File**: `packages/trpc/src/routers/planned_activities.ts`

Added `validateConstraints` query that checks:
- ✅ Weekly TSS limit (does new workout exceed max weekly TSS?)
- ✅ Workouts per week target (does this exceed target count?)
- ✅ Consecutive training days (does this create too many days in a row?)
- ✅ Rest days per week (does this reduce rest days below minimum?)
- ⚠️ Hard workout spacing (basic implementation, needs intensity tracking)

**Response format**:
```typescript
{
  constraints: {
    weeklyTSS: { status: "satisfied" | "warning" | "violated", current, withNew, limit },
    workoutsPerWeek: { status, current, withNew, limit },
    consecutiveDays: { status, current, withNew, limit },
    restDays: { status, current, withNew, minimum },
    hardWorkoutSpacing: { status, minimumHours }
  },
  canSchedule: boolean,
  hasWarnings: boolean
}
```

#### 2. Frontend: Modal Components

**Directory**: `apps/mobile/src/app/(internal)/(tabs)/plan/training-plan/modals/`

**Components Created**:

1. **AddWorkoutModal.tsx** (302 lines)
   - Main modal container
   - Orchestrates workout selection, intensity picking, and validation
   - Handles scheduling mutation
   - Shows appropriate warnings/errors

2. **WorkoutSelector.tsx** (198 lines)
   - Searchable list of available workouts
   - Displays workout details (name, type, duration, TSS)
   - Activity type icons
   - Selection indicator

3. **IntensityPicker.tsx** (167 lines)
   - Five intensity levels: Recovery, Easy, Moderate, Hard, Race
   - Radio button group with descriptions
   - Color-coded by intensity
   - Helper functions for intensity display

4. **ConstraintValidator.tsx** (209 lines)
   - Real-time validation panel
   - Shows all constraint checks with visual feedback
   - Summary status (all satisfied / has warnings / violated)
   - Contextual warning messages

5. **ConstraintIndicator.tsx** (154 lines)
   - Individual constraint status row
   - Visual indicator (checkmark/warning/X)
   - Current vs new value display
   - Color-coded status (green/yellow/red)

### Usage Example

```tsx
import { AddWorkoutModal } from "@/app/(internal)/(tabs)/plan/training-plan/modals";

function CalendarDay({ date, planId }) {
  const [showModal, setShowModal] = useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <Button onPress={() => setShowModal(true)}>
        Schedule Workout
      </Button>
      
      <AddWorkoutModal
        visible={showModal}
        onClose={() => setShowModal(false)}
        selectedDate={date}
        trainingPlanId={planId}
        onSuccess={() => {
          // Refresh calendar data
        }}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Key Features
- ✅ Real-time constraint validation
- ✅ Visual feedback with color coding
- ✅ Search and filter workouts
- ✅ Intensity level selection
- ✅ Warning/error messages
- ✅ Override capability (schedule anyway)
- ✅ Loading and error states
- ✅ Responsive UI

### Limitations & Future Improvements
1. **Intensity Tracking**: Activities don't store intensity yet, so hard workout spacing validation is incomplete
2. **Plan Linking**: Need to add `training_plan_id` to `planned_activities.create` mutation
3. **Workout Templates**: Could add quick-select templates or favorites
4. **Bulk Scheduling**: No support for scheduling multiple workouts at once

---

## Phase 5: Trends & Analytics

### Goal
Provide comprehensive training analytics with CTL/ATL/TSB tracking, weekly summaries, and intensity distribution analysis.

### What Was Built

#### 1. Backend: Analytics Endpoints
**File**: `packages/trpc/src/routers/training_plans.ts`

Added four new queries:

1. **getIdealCurve** - Generates ideal CTL/ATL progression based on periodization template
   ```typescript
   input: { id: planId, start_date, end_date }
   output: { dataPoints: [{ date, ctl, atl, tsb }], startCTL, targetCTL, targetDate }
   ```

2. **getActualCurve** - Calculates actual CTL/ATL/TSB from completed activities
   ```typescript
   input: { start_date, end_date }
   output: { dataPoints: [{ date, ctl, atl, tsb }] }
   ```

3. **getWeeklySummary** - Week-by-week planned vs actual performance
   ```typescript
   input: { training_plan_id, weeks_back: 12 }
   output: [{ weekStart, weekEnd, plannedTSS, completedTSS, tssPercentage, 
             plannedWorkouts, completedWorkouts, workoutPercentage, status }]
   ```

4. **getIntensityDistribution** - Target vs actual intensity breakdown
   ```typescript
   input: { training_plan_id, start_date, end_date }
   output: { target: {...}, actual: {...}, totalActivities, recommendations: [] }
   ```

#### 2. Frontend: Trends Screen
**File**: `apps/mobile/src/app/(internal)/(tabs)/trends.tsx`

Complete rewrite (643 lines) with three tabs:

##### **Overview Tab**
- Current form status (Fresh/Optimal/Tired/Overreached)
- CTL/ATL/TSB metrics with explanations
- This week's progress (TSS and workout completion)
- Training trend summary
- Periodization target display (if configured)

##### **Weekly Tab**
- Last 12 weeks breakdown
- Status indicator (✓/⚠️/❌) per week
- Planned vs actual TSS and workouts
- Completion percentages
- Color-coded cards (green/yellow/red)

##### **Intensity Tab**
- Target vs actual distribution for all five intensities
- Visual status indicators per intensity level
- Difference percentage calculation
- Color-coded feedback
- AI-generated recommendations

#### 3. Components
**File**: `apps/mobile/src/app/(internal)/(tabs)/trends/components/TimeRangeSelector.tsx`

- Button group for time period selection
- Options: 3 Months, 6 Months, 12 Months, All Time
- Helper function to calculate date ranges
- Active state styling

### Key Features
- ✅ Three-tab interface (Overview/Weekly/Intensity)
- ✅ Time range selector (3M/6M/12M/All)
- ✅ Real-time training load calculations (CTL/ATL/TSB)
- ✅ Form status with color coding
- ✅ Week-by-week performance tracking
- ✅ Intensity distribution analysis
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Empty states with CTAs
- ✅ Responsive design

### Data Flow

```
User opens Trends screen
  ↓
Load training plan
  ↓
Load current status (CTL/ATL/TSB)
  ↓
[Overview Tab]
  → Load actual curve for selected time range
  → Load ideal curve (if periodization exists)
  → Display metrics and progress

[Weekly Tab]
  → Load weekly summary (last 12 weeks)
  → Calculate completion percentages
  → Determine status (good/warning/poor)

[Intensity Tab]
  → Load intensity distribution
  → Compare target vs actual
  → Generate recommendations
```

### Limitations & Future Improvements

1. **Charting**: Currently text-based display, needs proper line chart library (Victory Native, Recharts)
2. **Intensity Tracking**: Uses mock data until activities store intensity
3. **Date Picker**: Time range is preset options, could add custom date picker
4. **Export**: No data export or sharing functionality
5. **Comparison**: Can't compare multiple time periods side-by-side
6. **Goals**: No goal setting or milestone tracking
7. **Notifications**: No alerts for form status changes

## Database Changes Required

### 1. Add Intensity to Activities
```sql
ALTER TABLE activities 
ADD COLUMN intensity TEXT CHECK (intensity IN ('recovery', 'easy', 'moderate', 'hard', 'race'));
```

### 2. Add Training Plan Link to Planned Activities
```sql
ALTER TABLE planned_activities 
ADD COLUMN training_plan_id UUID REFERENCES training_plans(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

CREATE INDEX idx_planned_activities_training_plan_id ON planned_activities(training_plan_id);
```

### 3. Add Intensity to Planned Activities (Optional)
```sql
ALTER TABLE planned_activities 
ADD COLUMN intensity TEXT CHECK (intensity IN ('recovery', 'easy', 'moderate', 'hard', 'race'));
```

## Performance Considerations

### Backend Optimizations
1. **Constraint Validation**: Queries are scoped to relevant date ranges (±3 days, 1 week)
2. **Curve Calculation**: Uses efficient time-constant formulas (CTL/ATL)
3. **Caching**: Consider adding React Query stale time for status data (5 minutes)

### Frontend Optimizations
1. **Conditional Queries**: Endpoints only run when tab is active (`enabled` flag)
2. **Memo Components**: Consider memoizing week cards and constraint indicators
3. **Lazy Loading**: Weekly summary could be paginated for >12 weeks
4. **Debouncing**: Workout search could be debounced (currently instant)
