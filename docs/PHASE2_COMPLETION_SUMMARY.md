# Phase 2 Completion Summary - Backend API

**Date:** 2025-01-23  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Phase:** Backend API Implementation  
**Next Phase:** Mobile Integration (Phase 3)

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 2 of the intensity calculation refactor is **complete and ready for production**. All backend tRPC endpoints have been implemented, tested, and documented. The system now supports a scientifically-accurate 7-zone intensity system that calculates intensity metrics retrospectively from actual workout data.

**Key Achievement:** Moved from prescriptive intensity assignment to measurement-based intensity calculation using Intensity Factor (IF) and Training Stress Score (TSS).

---

## What Was Delivered

### 1. New tRPC Endpoints (5 Total)

#### 1.1 `activities.list`
- **Purpose:** Fetch activities within a date range
- **Returns:** Activities with IF, TSS, and all standard fields
- **Use Case:** Query activities for analysis and display

#### 1.2 `activities.update`
- **Purpose:** Update activity metrics after calculation
- **Accepts:** intensity_factor (0-200), training_stress_score, normalized_power
- **Use Case:** Store calculated metrics after workout completion

#### 1.3 `training_plans.getIntensityDistribution`
- **Purpose:** Calculate TSS-weighted intensity distribution across 7 zones
- **Returns:** Percentage distribution + training recommendations
- **Use Case:** Display intensity trends and provide coaching insights
- **Enhancement:** Made training_plan_id optional for flexible date range analysis

#### 1.4 `training_plans.getIntensityTrends`
- **Purpose:** Analyze intensity patterns over time (weekly grouping)
- **Returns:** Weekly TSS, average IF, and zone distribution per week
- **Use Case:** Track training progression and detect patterns

#### 1.5 `training_plans.checkHardWorkoutSpacing`
- **Purpose:** Identify insufficient recovery between hard workouts
- **Returns:** List of spacing violations (IF ≥ 0.85, < 48h apart)
- **Use Case:** Retrospective recovery analysis and training insights

## Technical Implementation

### 7-Zone Intensity System

| Zone          | IF Range    | Description                      |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Recovery      | < 0.55      | Active recovery, very easy       |
| Endurance     | 0.55-0.74   | Aerobic base building            |
| Tempo         | 0.75-0.84   | Steady state, "gray zone"        |
| Threshold     | 0.85-0.94   | Lactate threshold training       |
| VO2max        | 0.95-1.04   | VO2max intervals                 |
| Anaerobic     | 1.05-1.14   | Anaerobic capacity               |
| Neuromuscular | ≥ 1.15      | Sprint power, neuromuscular      |

### Core Functions Used

- `getTrainingIntensityZone(intensityFactor)` - Classifies IF into 7 zones
- `calculateTrainingIntensityFactor(np, ftp)` - Calculates IF from power
- `calculateTrainingTSS(duration, if)` - Calculates TSS from duration and IF

All functions imported from `@repo/core` package.

### Code Quality

- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ Proper null safety and error handling
- ✅ Zod schema validation on inputs
- ✅ Type-safe responses
- ✅ Authentication middleware enforced
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies respected

---

## Training Science Integration

### Polarized Training Model

The system implements **polarized training recommendations**:
- **80% Easy**: Recovery + Endurance zones (IF < 0.75)
- **20% Hard**: Threshold + VO2max + Anaerobic + Neuromuscular (IF ≥ 0.85)
- **Minimize Tempo**: "Gray zone" training can limit polarization benefits

### Recommendations Engine

The `getIntensityDistribution` endpoint provides smart recommendations:

1. **Too much easy training** (>90%) → Suggest adding intensity
2. **Too little easy training** (<70%) → Suggest more recovery
3. **High hard training** (>30%) → Warn about overtraining risk
4. **High tempo training** (>20%) → Warn about gray zone issues

### Recovery Analysis

The `checkHardWorkoutSpacing` endpoint identifies:
- Hard workouts too close together (< 48 hours)
- Patterns that may lead to overtraining
- Training blocks with insufficient recovery

---

## Data Flow Architecture

### Before Workout (Planning)
```
User schedules workout → No intensity assigned
Activity plan has estimated_tss for planning only
System uses estimated_tss for weekly TSS forecasting
```

### During Workout (Recording)
```
User records activity → Power/HR/Pace data captured
Data stored in activity_streams table
No intensity calculated yet
```

### After Workout (Analysis)
```
Activity completed → Power stream processed
Normalized Power calculated → IF calculated (NP/FTP)
TSS calculated (duration × IF² × 100 / 3600)
Store IF, TSS, NP in activities table
```

### Display Time
```
Load activity.intensity_factor (e.g., 82 = 0.82)
Derive zone: getTrainingIntensityZone(0.82) → "tempo"
Display to user: "Tempo intensity (IF 0.82, TSS 65)"
```

---

## Database Schema

### Activities Table (Existing Columns)
```sql
-- Calculated metrics (populated after workout)
intensity_factor integer,           -- 0-200 (represents 0.00-2.00)
training_stress_score integer,      -- TSS value
normalized_power integer,           -- Watts (cycling)

-- NO intensity_zone column (derived at runtime)
```

### No Schema Changes Required
- Used existing columns
- No migrations needed
- Backward compatible with existing data

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization
- Date range filtering on `started_at` column
- Profile filtering with RLS policies
- Efficient aggregation using TSS-weighted percentages

### Recommended Indexes
```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_activities_profile_started 
  ON activities(profile_id, started_at);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_activities_intensity 
  ON activities(profile_id, intensity_factor) 
  WHERE intensity_factor IS NOT NULL;
```

### Target Response Times
- `activities.list`: < 200ms for 100 activities
- `getIntensityDistribution`: < 500ms for 1000 activities
- `getIntensityTrends`: < 1s for 52 weeks
- `checkHardWorkoutSpacing`: < 300ms for 100 activities

---

## Breaking Changes

### None! 🎉

This implementation is **fully backward compatible**:
- No database schema changes
- Existing activities work without IF data
- Old intensity fields (if any) can be ignored
- Training plans unchanged (no intensity_distribution required)

---

## What's Next: Phase 3

### Critical Path Items

1. **Activity Completion Pipeline** (2 hours)
   - Implement `useCompleteActivity` hook
   - Calculate IF from power streams
   - Handle edge cases (no power, no FTP)

2. **Trends Screen Integration** (2 hours)
   - Replace mock data with real API calls
   - Display 7-zone distribution
   - Show weekly trends chart

3. **Recovery Insights** (1.5 hours)
   - Create recovery insights screen
   - Display hard workout spacing violations
   - Provide actionable recommendations

4. **UI Updates** (1.5 hours)
   - Add intensity badges to activity cards
   - Show zone colors and labels
