# Intensity Calculation Refactor - Executive Summary

**Date:** January 23, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Core Implementation Complete | üöß UI Updates Pending  
**Impact:** High - Changes core training plan philosophy

---

## What Changed

We refactored how GradientPeak handles workout intensity to align with training science best practices.

### Before (Incorrect)
- Intensity was **pre-assigned** during planning (recovery/easy/moderate/hard/race)
- Users had to guess intensity before the workout
- Training plans prescribed specific intensity distributions
- Constraints validated based on planned intensity

### After (Correct)
- Intensity is **calculated** from workout data after completion
- Intensity Factor (IF) = Normalized Power / FTP
- Training Stress Score (TSS) = (duration √ó IF¬≤ √ó 100) / 3600
- Intensity zones derived from IF at display time
- Constraints validate volume only (TSS, frequency, rest)

---

## Why This Matters

### Training Science Accuracy
‚úÖ Measures actual effort, not predicted effort  
‚úÖ Accounts for fatigue, weather, terrain, equipment  
‚úÖ Reflects real athlete performance  
‚úÖ Enables meaningful trend analysis

### User Experience
‚úÖ Simpler planning - no guessing intensity beforehand  
‚úÖ Flexible execution - train based on how you feel  
‚úÖ Accurate feedback - see real intensity afterward  
‚úÖ Better insights - analyze what actually happened

---

## Technical Changes

### Core Package (`packages/core/`)
- ‚úÖ Added `calculateIntensityFactor(NP, FTP)` 
- ‚úÖ Added `getIntensityZone(IF)` - derives zone from IF
- ‚úÖ Added `calculateTSS(duration, IF)` - TSS calculation
- ‚úÖ Added `estimateTSS(duration, effort)` - for planning
- ‚úÖ Removed intensity distribution schema
- ‚úÖ Removed hard workout spacing constraints

### tRPC API (`packages/trpc/`)
- ‚úÖ Updated `validateConstraints` to remove intensity field
- ‚úÖ Removed hard workout spacing validation
- ‚úÖ Changed to use `activity_plan_id` instead of intensity enum
- ‚úÖ Validates only volume-based constraints (TSS, frequency, rest)

### Database Schema
- ‚úÖ **No migration required!** Existing schema already has what we need:
  - `activities.intensity_factor` (0-100) stores IF
  - `activities.training_stress_score` stores TSS
  - `activity_plans.estimated_tss` for planning
- ‚ùå No new columns added
- ‚ùå No intensity enums stored

### Mobile UI (Pending Updates)
- üöß Remove intensity picker from workout scheduling
- üöß Remove Step 4 (Intensity Distribution) from training plan wizard
- üöß Update trends screen to calculate zones from IF
- üöß Update constraint validation UI (remove hard workout spacing)

## Data Flow

### Planning Phase
```
User schedules workout
  ‚Üì
Links to activity_plan (has estimated_tss)
  ‚Üì
System validates volume constraints
  ‚Üì
NO intensity assigned
```

### Recording Phase
```
User completes workout
  ‚Üì
Power/HR/Pace data recorded
  ‚Üì
Calculate Normalized Power
  ‚Üì
Calculate IF = NP / FTP
  ‚Üì
Calculate TSS = (duration √ó IF¬≤) / 3600
  ‚Üì
Store IF and TSS in activities table
```

### Display Phase
```
Load activity.intensity_factor (e.g., 82 = 0.82)
  ‚Üì
Derive zone: getIntensityZone(0.82) ‚Üí "moderate"
  ‚Üì
Display: "Moderate (IF 0.82) - 56 TSS"
```

---

## Constraints: What Changed

### Can Validate Proactively ‚úÖ
- Weekly TSS limits (use estimated_tss)
- Workout frequency per week
- Consecutive training days
- Minimum rest days per week

### Cannot Validate Proactively ‚ùå
- Hard workout spacing (need actual IF)
- Intensity distribution (need actual IF)
- Effort balance (need actual IF)

### Can Analyze Retrospectively ‚úÖ
After workouts are completed:
- Calculate actual intensity distribution
- Check hard workout spacing violations
- Identify training imbalances
- Generate recommendations

---

## Breaking Changes

### API Changes
```typescript
// ‚ùå OLD
validateConstraints({
  training_plan_id,
  scheduled_date,
  activity: {
    estimated_tss: 60,
    intensity: "moderate"  // Removed
  }
})

// ‚úÖ NEW
validateConstraints({
  training_plan_id,
  scheduled_date,
  activity_plan_id  // Gets estimated_tss from activity_plans
})
```

### Training Plan Structure
```json
// ‚ùå Removed from JSONB structure
{
  "intensity_distribution": { ... },
  "min_hours_between_hard": 48,
  "max_hard_activities_per_week": 2
}

// ‚úÖ These remain
{
  "target_weekly_tss_min": 200,
  "target_weekly_tss_max": 400,
  "target_activities_per_week": 5,
  "max_consecutive_days": 3,
  "min_rest_days_per_week": 1
}
```

---

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Data
- **Activities**: If they have `intensity_factor`, you're good. Zones derived on the fly.
- **Planned Activities**: Any old intensity fields are ignored.
- **Training Plans**: Old intensity_distribution in JSONB is optional, won't break anything.

### For Developers
1. Remove any UI components for intensity selection
2. Use `getIntensityZone(IF)` to display zones
3. Don't query or store intensity enums
4. Use `activity_plans.estimated_tss` for planning

### For Users
- **No action required** - The system handles everything automatically
- Intensity now appears on completed workouts, not planned ones
- More accurate, less guessing

## Benefits

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Accuracy** | Guessed | Measured from actual data |
| **Flexibility** | Rigid pre-assignment | Adapt to how you feel |
| **Complexity** | 5 intensity levels | Just IF value |
| **Planning** | Must predict intensity | Just link to workout |
| **Analysis** | Based on plans | Based on reality |
| **Database** | Store enums | Calculate from IF |
