- Shares same components (CurrentStatusCard, etc.)

**With tRPC:**
- Uses `trpc.trainingPlans.get` for plan data
- Uses `trpc.trainingPlans.create` for plan creation
- Ready for `trpc.plannedActivities.listByWeek`
- Ready for `trpc.activities.list` with filtering

**With Navigation:**
- Proper Expo Router integration
- Type-safe route navigation
- Back navigation handling
- Parameter passing for pre-selection

## Known Limitations & TODOs

### Backend Dependencies

**Calendar (Phase 2):**
```typescript
// TODO: Implement these endpoints
- trpc.plannedActivities.listByWeek({ week_start, week_end })
- trpc.activities.list({ date_from, date_to })
```

**Future Phases:**
```typescript
// Phase 4: Workout Scheduling
- trpc.trainingPlans.validateWorkout(...)
- trpc.plannedActivities.reschedule(...)
- trpc.plannedActivities.delete(...)

// Phase 5: Trends & Analytics
- trpc.trainingPlans.getHistoricalMetrics(...)
- trpc.trainingPlans.getProgressionCurves(...)
```
