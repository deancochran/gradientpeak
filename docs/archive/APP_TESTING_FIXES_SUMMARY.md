# App Testing Fixes Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the fixes implemented in response to app testing findings related to permissions, UI state management, and the recording flow.

## Testing Findings Addressed

### Pre-Recording Notes

#### 1. ‚úÖ Permissions Not Proactive
**Issue:** Permissions were not proactively checked. The app did not check device state when viewing/mounting the permissions modal or prior to starting an activity.

**Fix:**
- Added proactive permission checking when permissions modal mounts
- Implemented 2-second polling to detect permission changes in real-time
- Updated `ActivityRecorderService` with `checkPermissions()` method that emits events
- Permissions now automatically refresh when modal is visible

**Files Changed:**
- `apps/mobile/src/app/record/permissions.tsx`
- `apps/mobile/src/lib/services/ActivityRecorder/index.ts`
- `apps/mobile/src/lib/hooks/useActivityRecorderEvents.ts`

#### 2. ‚úÖ Permissions Subscription
**Issue:** The app should subscribe to granted permissions to get latest values and emit events on changes.

**Fix:**
- Implemented permission event emission in `ActivityRecorderService`
- Hook-based subscription pattern via `usePermissions()` and `usePermissionActions()`
- Real-time updates when permissions change
- Event-driven architecture ensures UI stays synchronized

**Files Changed:**
- `apps/mobile/src/lib/services/ActivityRecorder/index.ts`
- `apps/mobile/src/lib/hooks/useActivityRecorderEvents.ts`

### Whiteboard Notes

#### 3. ‚úÖ Display: All Cards Should Be Displayed Prior to Starting Activity
**Issue:** Cards were only visible after starting recording, hiding what would be tracked from users.

**Fix:**
- Updated card visibility logic to show all cards in `pending` and `ready` states
- Cards now display when `state !== "finished"` instead of only during `recording` or `paused`
- Includes: Power, Heart Rate, Analysis, Elevation, Map, and Plan cards
- Users can now see all metrics before recording begins

**Files Changed:**
- `apps/mobile/src/app/record/index.tsx`

#### 4. ‚úÖ Sensors: Stream Values Only After Activity Starts
**Issue:** Sensors should only stream values to the UI after the user starts an activity.

**Fix:**
- `LiveMetricsManager` only starts calculating metrics after `startRecording()` is called
- Recording state gates ensure metrics are only processed during active recording
- Clean separation between prepared state (no streaming) and active state (streaming)
- Sensors connect but don't push data to metrics until recording begins

**Implementation:**
- `LiveMetricsManager.startRecording(recordingId)` called in `ActivityRecorderService.startRecording()`
- Metrics are calculated only when recording is active
- No persistence or calculation in prepared state

#### 5. ‚úÖ Metrics: Calculated Metrics Start After Activity Begins
**Issue:** Calculated metrics should only start computing after recording begins.

**Fix:**
- `LiveMetricsManager` controls metric calculation lifecycle
- Metrics (TSS, NP, IF, VI, etc.) only calculated during active recording
- No premature calculation in prepared state
- Event emission tied to recording state

**Architecture:**
```typescript
// Only during recording:
this.liveMetricsManager.startRecording(recording.id);
// Metrics calculation begins here
```

#### 6. ‚úÖ Live Readings: Show "Prepared" State
**Issue:** Live metrics should display simple readings that indicate the "prepared" state before recording.

**Fix:**
- All cards now show "prepared state" UI when in pending/ready states
- Placeholder values (`---` or `--`) with muted styling
- Green checkmark with "READY" indicator replaces "LIVE" indicator
- Clear messaging about what will be tracked
- Informational text explaining sensor/data requirements

**Cards Updated:**
1. **Dashboard Card** - Shows placeholder metrics for all tracking categories
2. **Power Card** - "Power Metrics Ready" with placeholder watts
3. **Heart Rate Card** - "Heart Rate Monitoring Ready" with placeholder BPM
4. **Analysis Card** - "Analysis Engine Ready" with placeholder TSS/IF/VI
5. **Elevation Card** - "Elevation Tracking Ready" with placeholder elevation

**Files Changed:**
- `apps/mobile/src/app/record/index.tsx`
- `apps/mobile/src/components/dashboard/PowerCard.tsx`
- `apps/mobile/src/components/dashboard/HeartRateCard.tsx`
- `apps/mobile/src/components/dashboard/AnalysisCard.tsx`
- `apps/mobile/src/components/dashboard/ElevationCard.tsx`

## Implementation Details

### Prepared State Pattern

All cards use a consistent pattern:

```typescript
const recordingState = useRecordingState(service);
const isPrepared = recordingState === "pending" || recordingState === "ready";

if (isPrepared) {
  return <PreparedStateUI />;
}

// ... normal active state UI
```

### Visual Design System

**Prepared State Indicators:**
- ‚úÖ Green checkmark icon
- "READY" text label
- Muted colors (`text-muted-foreground/30`)
- Placeholder values (`---`, `--`)
- Informational messages
- Reduced opacity for emphasis

**Active State Indicators:**
- üî¥ Pulsing red/green dot
- "LIVE" or "GPS" text label
- Full-color metrics
- Real-time values
- High contrast and emphasis

### Permission Polling Strategy

```typescript
// Check on mount
useEffect(() => {
  if (service) {
    check();
  }
}, [service, check]);

// Poll every 2 seconds while modal is open
useEffect(() => {
  if (!service) return;

  const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
    check();
  }, 2000);

  return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
}, [service, check]);
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before These Fixes
- ‚ùå Permissions not checked proactively
- ‚ùå Cards hidden until recording started
- ‚ùå No indication of what would be tracked
- ‚ùå Confusing when cards "appeared" after starting
- ‚ùå No clear "ready" state feedback

### After These Fixes
- ‚úÖ Permissions checked automatically and continuously
- ‚úÖ All cards visible before recording
- ‚úÖ Clear placeholder values show what will be tracked
- ‚úÖ "READY" indicators provide confidence
- ‚úÖ Smooth transition from prepared to active state
- ‚úÖ Better user understanding and expectation setting

## Testing Verification

### Test Cases

1. **Permission Checking**
   - [ ] Open permissions modal ‚Üí permissions checked immediately
   - [ ] Enable permission in system settings ‚Üí app detects within 2 seconds
   - [ ] Disable permission in system settings ‚Üí app detects within 2 seconds
   - [ ] All three permission types update correctly

2. **Card Visibility**
   - [ ] Open recording modal ‚Üí all cards visible
   - [ ] Power card shows in prepared state
   - [ ] Heart rate card shows in prepared state
   - [ ] Analysis card shows in prepared state
   - [ ] Elevation card shows in prepared state
   - [ ] All cards show "READY" indicator

3. **Prepared State UI**
   - [ ] Placeholder values display as `---` or `--`
   - [ ] Colors are muted (`text-muted-foreground/30`)
   - [ ] Green checkmarks visible
   - [ ] Informational messages clear and helpful

4. **State Transition**

   - [ ] "READY" changes to "LIVE"
   - [ ] Placeholder values replaced with real data
   - [ ] Colors change to full brightness
   - [ ] Pulsing indicators appear

5. **Sensor Streaming**

- **Prepared State**: Cards visible, no data streaming
- **Active State**: Cards visible, data streaming
- **Finished State**: Results displayed

### Type-Safe Hooks
- `useRecordingState()` - Get current recording state
- `usePermissions()` - Subscribe to all permissions
- `usePermissionActions()` - Check/ensure permissions
