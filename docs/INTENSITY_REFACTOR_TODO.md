  - ‚úÖ Removed "target" distribution (no longer stored)
  - ‚úÖ TSS-weighted percentages
  - ‚úÖ Training science-based recommendations (polarized training)

#### New Retrospective Analysis Endpoints
- [x] `activities.list(date_from, date_to)` 
  - ‚úÖ Added list endpoint to activities router
  - ‚úÖ Filters by date range
  - ‚úÖ Includes intensity_factor and training_stress_score
  - ‚úÖ Returns all activities for profile

- [x] `activities.update(id, intensity_factor?, training_stress_score?, normalized_power?)`
  - ‚úÖ Added update endpoint for setting calculated metrics
  - ‚úÖ Allows updating IF and TSS after workout processing

- [x] `training_plans.getIntensityTrends(weeks_back)`
  - ‚úÖ Shows IF trends over time by week
  - ‚úÖ Groups activities by week (Monday start)
  - ‚úÖ Calculates average IF per week
  - ‚úÖ Shows TSS-weighted zone distribution per week
  - ‚úÖ Helps users see training patterns

- [x] `training_plans.checkHardWorkoutSpacing(start_date, end_date, min_hours)`
  - ‚úÖ Analyzes completed workouts for spacing violations
  - ‚úÖ Uses IF >= 0.85 to determine "hard" workouts
  - ‚úÖ Returns list of workouts that were too close together
  - ‚úÖ Configurable minimum hours between hard workouts (default: 48h)</parameter>
</parameter>
  - Include average IF per zone

## üìù Documentation Updates

### User-Facing Documentation
- [ ] Update training plan guide to remove intensity prescription
- [ ] Add explanation of IF and TSS to help section
- [ ] Create FAQ about why intensity isn't set beforehand
- [ ] Add examples of interpreting IF values

### Developer Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation for changed endpoints
- [ ] Add examples of retrospective intensity analysis
- [ ] Document the IF ‚Üí Zone mapping clearly

---

## üß™ Testing

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test `calculateTrainingIntensityFactor()` with various inputs
- [ ] Test `getTrainingIntensityZone()` boundary conditions for all 7 zones
- [ ] Test `calculateTrainingTSS()` formula accuracy
- [ ] Test `estimateTSS()` returns reasonable values
- [ ] Test zone transitions at IF boundaries (0.55, 0.75, 0.85, 0.95, 1.05, 1.15)

### Integration Tests
- [x] Test `validateConstraints` without intensity field - ‚úÖ Working
- [x] Test training plan creation without intensity distribution - ‚úÖ Working
- [ ] Test activity display calculates zones correctly with 7 zones
- [ ] Test trends screen with real IF data from backend

### E2E Tests
- [x] Schedule workout without intensity picker - ‚úÖ UI Updated
- [x] Complete training plan wizard (4 steps) - ‚úÖ UI Updated
- [ ] View activity with calculated intensity (7 zones)
- [ ] View trends with intensity distribution (needs backend update)

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [x] All UI components updated
- [x] No references to old intensity enums in mobile code (now using 7 zones)
- [x] No calls to removed tRPC endpoints
- [x] Training plan wizard flows correctly (4 steps)
- [x] Constraint validation works without intensity
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes with no errors

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor for errors related to missing intensity fields
- [ ] Verify activities display IF correctly with 7 zones
- [ ] Update backend `getIntensityDistribution` to use actual IF calculations
- [ ] Check that trends calculate zones properly (needs backend update)
- [ ] Ensure no users are blocked by missing fields
- [ ] Verify training plan creation stores correct structure (no intensity_distribution)

## üí° Future Enhancements

### Smart Recommendations (Phase 2)
- [ ] Analyze if user is doing too much hard work (IF > 0.90)
- [ ] Suggest recovery weeks based on IF trends
- [ ] Warn if intensity distribution is too polarized/pyramidal

### Advanced Analytics (Phase 3)
- [ ] IF progression over training block
- [ ] Decoupling analysis (efficiency factor)
- [ ] Power duration curve from IF data
- [ ] Training efficiency metrics

### AI Coach Integration (Phase 4)
- [ ] AI suggests workouts based on recent IF trends
- [ ] Adaptive planning based on actual vs planned intensity
- [ ] Fatigue detection from IF patterns

---

## üêõ Known Issues

### Edge Cases to Handle
- [ ] Activities without `intensity_factor` (no power data)
  - Solution: Use estimated IF from HR or pace

- [ ] Very old activities with stored intensity enum
  - Solution: Ignore old field, calculate from IF if available

- [ ] Training plans with old intensity_distribution in JSONB
  - Solution: Field is optional, just don't use it

## üìû Support

### If Users Ask "Where did intensity go?"
**Answer:**
"Intensity is now calculated automatically after your workout based on your actual performance (power, heart rate, pace). This is more accurate than guessing beforehand. You'll see your intensity factor (IF) and zone on completed activities."

### If Users Ask "How do I know what intensity to train at?"
**Answer:**
"Your workout description tells you (e.g., 'easy run' or 'threshold intervals'). Train based on how you feel and your power/pace zones. The app will measure the actual intensity after you're done."
