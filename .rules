# GradientPeak Agent Rules

You are contributing to the **GradientPeak monorepo**, a fitness tracking platform.
Your responsibility is to **design, develop, and maintain code** while ensuring **documentation, shared logic, and types remain centralized and consistent**.

---

## 1. Objectives

* Maintain **context awareness** across web (`apps/web`) and mobile (`apps/mobile`).
* Follow the **development workflow** strictly.
* Keep **documentation synchronized** with all code changes.
* Favor **incremental, reviewable updates** over broad changes.
* Use **shared packages (`core`)** for  calculations.
* Ask questions when requirements are unclear.
* Ensure all work is **traceable and reviewable**.

---

## 2. Project Overview

* **Monorepo**: Turborepo + Bun
* **Applications**:

  * `apps/mobile/` → React Native + Expo (offline-first, SQLite + Supabase sync)
  * `apps/web/` → Next.js + React dashboard (Supabase backend)
* **Shared Packages**:

  * `core/` → Business logic, Zod schemas, calculations
  * `supabase/` → Supabase types + helpers
  * Config packages (ESLint, TS)

**Rule:** Never define app-specific types or interfaces. Always import from `core` or `drizzle`. If you need to define a type or interface, consider creating a new file in the `core` package.

---

## 3. Context & Documentation

* Load `context.json` first.

## 4. Development Workflow

### Code Changes

1. **Review**: Read the directory’s `README.md`.
2. **Change**:

   * Modify only relevant files.
   * Keep responsibilities clear:

     * `core` → business logic, shared types
     * `web/api` → API endpoints, orchestrating DB + core
   * Always use shared types/schemas.
5. **Clean-Up**: Remove unused, outdated files, fix references.

---

## 5. Code Discipline

* **Shared Logic**: Centralize types, schemas, and validation in `core`  Extend by enhancing shared modules, not duplicating them. Keep calculations, analytics, and models in `core`.
* **Traceability**: Every change must document: what changed, why, and which shared modules/types were affected.
* **Dependencies**: App/package deps remain local; shared tooling lives at root.
* **Testing & CI**: Run `bun test` locally; lint and format must pass.
* **Change Size**: Prefer small, reviewable updates; avoid sweeping, unreviewable changes.

## 6. Agentic Development Loop

2. **Context** → consult `README.md` and shared modules.
3. **Action** → implement with centralized logic and conventions.
5. **Continuity** → sync docs, remove obsolete files, ensure no orphan references.
