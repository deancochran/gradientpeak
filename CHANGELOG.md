- âœ… Planned activity integration with real-time guidance
- âœ… Real performance metrics display on home screen
- âœ… Core business logic calculations functional
- âœ… Local-first data storage with cloud sync
- âœ… Streamlined activity completion workflow
- âœ… Activity summary modal with comprehensive performance analysis
- ðŸ”„ Activity detail screens in development
- ðŸ”„ Training plan system partially implemented
- ðŸ”„ Charts and analytics visualization in progress

### Fixed
- Added missing Zod dependency to core package
- Created core package README documentation
- Initialized CHANGELOG for project tracking
- Replaced basic recording screen with enhanced fault-tolerant version
- Eliminated blocking popups during activity recording sessions
- Fixed activity completion workflow to use single summary modal
