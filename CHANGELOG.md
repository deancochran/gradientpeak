## [Unreleased]

### Service Lifecycle Architecture Cleanup (2025-01-06)
- **Removed Global Service Initialization**: Service no longer initialized in root layout (`_layout.tsx`)
  - **Correct Lifecycle**: Service now only exists when user navigates to recording screen (`/record`)
  - **Automatic Cleanup**: Service automatically cleaned up when user navigates away (React useEffect cleanup)
  - **Navigation-Scoped**: Service lifecycle strictly follows: navigate-in → create → use → navigate-out → cleanup
  - **Memory Efficiency**: No persistent service consuming resources when not recording

- **Removed Legacy Hook References**: Eliminated all uses of deprecated `useActivityRecorderInit` hook
  - **Root Layout**: Removed incorrect service initialization from app root
  - **Submit Recording Modal**: Removed unnecessary service lifecycle management (service already cleaned up on navigation)
  - **Simplified Architecture**: Single service creation point in recording modal only

- **Deleted Deprecated Code**:
  - **Zustand Store**: Removed `activity-recorder-store.ts` (400+ lines) - replaced by event-driven hooks
  - **Archived Docs**: Moved legacy migration docs to `docs/archive/` folder
  - **Clean Codebase**: Zero references to old hook patterns remaining

- **Updated Documentation**:
  - **README.md**: Updated service lifecycle examples to reflect navigation-scoped architecture
  - **Hook Examples**: Replaced deprecated patterns with `useActivityRecorder()` and consolidated hooks
  - **Architecture Diagrams**: Clarified service creation happens only in recording screen

- **Key Benefits**:
  - **✅ Correct Lifecycle**: Service exists ONLY during recording session, not globally
  - **✅ Better Performance**: No unnecessary service running in background
  - **✅ Cleaner Architecture**: Single source of truth for service creation
  - **✅ Type Safety**: Service always available within recording screen context
  - **✅ Developer Experience**: Automatic lifecycle management via React hooks
  - **✅ Reliability**: Guaranteed cleanup prevents memory leaks and stale state
