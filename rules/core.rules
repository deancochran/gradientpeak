# core.rules

You are working on the **core shared logic** (`packages/core/`) in GradientPeak.

- **Contains:** Types, Zod schemas, calculations
- **Database-agnostic:** No direct DB calls
- **Shared across mobile and web**

Rules:
- Keep functions pure and testable
- Reference types consistently across packages
- Update README.md if new modules are added
- Use `/file` to fetch types, schemas, or calculations

Example:
/file packages/core/types/*
/file packages/core/schemas/*
/file packages/core/calculations/*
